# FocusTime

"Time-keeping for people who need to focus"

## Getting Set Up

To work with FocusTime, you need to set up the [BeeWare development framework](https://beeware.org/). [The BeeWare tutorial](https://docs.beeware.org/en/latest/) is a good place to start.

Note: If you're using VSCode, the `.vscode` folder includes some useful settings, but it assumes that the python virtual environment is set up in a directory called `venv`.

## Running the App

The *FocusTime* app can be run in developer mode from the `focustime` folder (not to be confused with `focustime/src/focustime`) with the command `briefcase dev`.

## Running Unit Tests

The unit test suite for *FocusTime* can be run from `focustime/src` using the `py -m focustime.tests` command.
